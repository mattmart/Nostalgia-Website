                    From being a mail service for old cd movies to now being a leader in the streaming world, Netflix has always understood a key concept, nostalgia sells. People want what they are familiar with, so if you offer them the same shows and movies they saw as kids, they usually will purchase it. The streaming service has focused on having old sitcoms like Friends, that 70s show, the Office, and Parks and Recreation. As you can probably imagine, the pandemic was a gold mine for Netflix as adults watched the tv shows they were used to in their free time.

                    Netflix’s future was looking bland a few years ago, as rival streaming services began to arise everywhere. Disney, HBO, Hulu, and Paramount Plus, all began to take their shows off of Netflix and placed them on their own streaming services. Netflix knew this would happen so they altered their game plan. Instead of focusing on old classic shows, they would create their own hit shows. Stranger Things is one of Netflix’s new big hits, and still uses nostalgia as a way to build an audience. The show attracts an audience from both newer and older generations by the show’s main cast being kids and the timeline being in the 80’s, making it an exceptional case of nostalgia marketing.

Taking the reigns of one of the most successful movie series ever was a risky move by Disney. Many critics believed the company would fail to keep the prestigious figure of star wars and turn the legendary series into a giant money grab. Right after buying Star Wars, Disney’s studio chief made it extremely clear that no character or plot point should be seen as a business decision. If this happened, then Disney would be viewed by millions of star wars fans as an evil corporation that destroyed the masterpiece they appreciated so much.

                        Disney has so far been able to avoid being deemed by all as that evil corporation. Many fans of star wars actually feel that Disney has revitalized the Series. Right before the pandemic Disney released the first season of the Mandalorian which was extremely successful. The internet fell in love with Baby Yoda and star wars fans everywhere were extremely pleased with the show.

                        The second season for the Mandalorian was released in October of 2020 during the lockdown, causing massive hype around the show.

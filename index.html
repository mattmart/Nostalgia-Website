                 In order to understand this marketing strategy, it is important to first understand <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/science/what-is-nostalgia-good-for-quite-a-bit-research-shows.html">the history of nostalgia.</a> According to columnist John Tierney, a distinguished writer for the New York Times, nostalgia was first coined as a term by a 17th-century Swiss physician who connected soldiers' mental troubles with their longing to return home. Nostalgia comes from the Greek words "nostos" meaning homecoming, and "algia" meaning pain. This negative look towards nostalgia would hinder studies done on the emotional feeling till the late 20th century.

                    It wasn’t until 1999 that University of Southampton’s professor Constantine Sedikides began to feel a longing for his past experiences at his alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, that studies were done on the emotion.  After over a decade of conducting studies, Sedikides and colleagues found that although nostalgia has its bad sides, it generally has a good effect on our health. When people talk about the past in a good light, they typically become more elated.

                        The usage of this emotion in the business world wasn’t thought of in past times since the study of nostalgia is relatively new. However, it didn’t take long for companies to  figure out how to use this emotion to influence consumers to buy their products…

                    As it turns out, marketing through nostalgia is fairly straight forward. All companies have to do is show a product to consumers that will cause them to reminisce over good times. This applies to really any products that were made when times were enjoyable for people. Companies do this in a variety of ways but it is most prominent in the entertainment industry with Disney, Netflix, and Nintendo being the frontrunners of this marketing strategy.

                The genius to this plot is how even if someone is having a bad day, the usage of nostalgia could cause their mood to change into a delightful one, where they would be more inclined to buy the product the company is selling.

                The pandemic was a shocking time for everyone. Society completely flipped upside down and all of a sudden everyone had plenty of free time. This free time led to thought and laziness, which allowed for people to reminisce on times in their life where they felt the most joy. When people remembered what they enjoyed, they would actively seek it out. One such case of this would be Club Penguin Rewritten.

            Club Penguin Rewritten was able to amass a huge audience over the pandemic. However, there were 3 other companies and products that were exceptionally more successful during the pandemic than Club Penguin Rewritten. Disney with their use of star wars, Netflix with their use of streaming older shows, and Nintendo using pokémon all were able to have an extremely lucrative time over the pandemic. These next portions of the website will go into detail about the reasons why these companies were successful and what to expect for the future of entertainment.

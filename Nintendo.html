                    Nintendo does an amazing job at using Nostalgia Marketing. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, and Bowser are names that almost anyone can recognize. The company constantly releases remakes and new games and shows with old but familiar characters to keep their aged audience buying their products. One such product of Nintendo is Pokemon.

                    Pokemon is a classic game for anyone born around the turn of the century. The goal of the game is to catch creatures called “pokemon” and use them to battle other trainers of pokemon. The game is fairly straight forward and easy to learn. Level up your creatures to beat opposing ones. While although simple, the game has caught the hearts of millions of young adults and kids.

                    As these young adults have grown older, they have also out-grown Pokemon. They no longer have the time to buy a Nintendo console and play the grindy game. Nintendo recognized this, and in an effort to keep the older audience around they created Pokemon Go, a mobile app designed around you being the trainer to walk around the real world catching pokemon through AR technology. The game blew up in 2016 and millions of old Pokemon players joined. However, the game failed to keep the audience around because of lack of features and fell off for a few years.

                    It wasn’t until the pandemic when the game exploded again. Nintendo had fixed a lot of issues with the game since 2016 and has made it really enjoyable for returning players.  <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/pokemon-go-statistics/">Statistics </a> show that 2020 has been the best year for Pokemon Go in terms of revenue and downloads.
